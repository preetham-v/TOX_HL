# TOX_HL
 It is a simple method for the determination of half-lives of drugs based on survival outcomes alone.
 
TOXHL involves 3 experiments: an acute toxicity experiment, a cumulative toxicity experiment, and a multi-dose experimentat different dosing intervals. Data obtained from these 3 experiment has been demonstrated to be sufficient to calculate the peritoneal half-life of the antimicrobial peptide, â„¦76.

survival_file #File which contains data on Survival vs conc

crit_died #Number of mice which died during time-spaced experiment

crit_total  #Total number of mice which were used during time-spaced experiment

conc_point  #Fraction of mice which died during time-spaced experiment

time_period  #Time period of dosage

conc_dosage  #Concentration of dosage

N_points #Number of dosages administered before witnessing first death

Usage: python dosage.py <file_name> <number_died> <total_number> <time_period> <dosage_conc> <dosage_points>

Please input the following for an example run -

Survival file is given as acute_toxicity.csv
Number of mice which died during multi-dose experiment = 2
Total number of mice which were used during multi-dose experiment = 6
Time period of dosage = 3
Concentration of dosage = 64
Number of dosages administered before witnessing first death = 5
